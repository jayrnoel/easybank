## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Git

### What I learned

I started to practice using a larger project to use SASS and Git. I have also started to use other development tools. I tried to use the VSCode extention on compiling SASS files but I settled on using the command line version of SASS. I have been using the Live Server extension before but I have been trying to use the Browser-sync. I have been having problems with live server for some time when it can't start and I need to restart VS Code or completely restart my computer.

This is the project where I used SASS extensively in writing my stylesheet. I find that using SASS makes it easier to find my code. I find it easier to know where I placed my selectors. There are times where I find it confusing where I placed my selector, whether on layouts or components or that sometimes I forget that I have other partials but at the end, looking at the file tree makes it easier for me to find my selectors.

I have learned that in order to animate the mobile menu from hidden to visible `display: none` and `opacity:0` doesn't work, I have learned the `visibility: hidden` is the best way to hide elements in this case as `display: none` won't be animated and `opacity: 0` will still block the elements below them.

### Continued development

I want to continue to practice responsive design. I am just becoming comfortable in writing flexbox and grids and I want to explore more on how I can layout better. I am also starting to use git in my projects, I am still using the desktop app but eventually I want to use the command line so I don't have to keep another app to track it.

### Useful resources
